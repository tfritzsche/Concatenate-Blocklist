	Concatblocklist, by Adam Cox
	This program can be used, in conjuction with Transmission,
	to automatically merge sereveral iBlocklist files into a
	single blocklist. 
	When supplied with the file location of a 
	\'blocklist menu\', it will download every individual blocklist 
	(in the p2p format), unpack any gzip files, and concatenate them 
	all into a single blocklist (in the p2p format), placed into 
	Transmission\'s /blocklist/ folder. The \'blocklist menu\' must 
	list 1+ URLS, separated by a newline character.
	All downloaded blocklist files are assumed to be in gzip format,
	as per standards on iblocklist.com. However, any file with the
	\'.txt\' suffix will be treated as a plain-text list in the p2p
	format.
	The suggested use for this program is for it to be run at user
	login, and the \'blocklist menu\' file be stored in 
	/Application Support/Transmission/.
